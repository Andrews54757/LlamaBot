Create a JSON object containing the name, game version, authors, description, and a list of features extracted from a given text.

Example:

Input:
**[1.20.3+] 2wABt Parallel Red MIS**
*By @RedGrosso, with help from @Walter and @MoonyResearched, based on design by @InspectorTalon and @RaPsCaLLioN1138*

Features:
* Slice is very compact (5x9x2)
* Can sort one item stack every 24gts (up to 21x hopper speed)
* Sorts both 64 & 16 stackables
* Unstackables are sent to their own output
* Boxes are automatically unloaded

Cons:
* Noisy
* Each category is limited to 1x hopper speed. If too many items are sent to one slice they get recycled through the system, potentially preventing other categories from receiving items.
* Extremely large, continuous input to a single category can cause items to be incorrectly sent to unsorted. This can be mitigated by increasing the inslice buffer.

Additional Credits:
* Chest-Minecart Input: @KikuGie & @Philgoodinator
* Shulker box Unloader: @Christone & @javi
* Cart Yeeter: @C5, @Inspector Talon, et al.
