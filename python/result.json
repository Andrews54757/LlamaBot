    "description": "Accepts non-empty boxes of a single item type, and over time merges them, so that only full and empty boxes are produced. Intended for integration with box sorting.",
    "features": [
        "11x8x2 per slice, AB tileable (powered rails <-> activator rails, slime <-> honey,",
        "1x hopper speed,",
        "Vaguely built off of floppy's merge slice design,",
        "at least 5 out of 6 hoppers can be locked (see levers on red concrete); 1 is always locked,",
        "Precision collection of broken merging box,",
        "Empty boxes get discarded to a water stream beneath, while full boxes are stored,",
        "Underside button to break/swap merging box with unloading one and reset slice; may need to press twice to extract last box,",
        "only 2 dust per slice: 1 to detect fill level of the merge box, 1 to lock the transfer hopper at the moment of breaking the boxes,"
    ],
    "cons": [
        "one full box is buffered (until the next box's fill level changes),",
        "can be sluggish (see issues),"
    ]
